**Final grade: 112%**:white_check_mark: <br>
This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves. To make this happen, you will have to manipulate various sorting algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution(s) for optimized data sorting.

**number of instructions and score:** <br>
sort hundred numbers<br>
less than 700   -> 5<br>
less than 900   -> 4<br>
less than 1100  -> 3<br>
less than 1300  -> 2<br>
less than 1500  -> 1<br>

sort five hundred numbers<br>
less than 5500  -> 5<br>
less than 7000  -> 4<br>
less than 8500  -> 3<br>
less than 10000 -> 2<br>
less than 11500 -> 1<br>

I got 5 in sorting hundred numbers and 4 in sorting five hundred numbers, and 112% as the final grade.(not perfect)<br>
